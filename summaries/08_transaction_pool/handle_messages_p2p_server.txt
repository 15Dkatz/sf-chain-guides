Update the messageHandler in the peer to peer server to handle different types of messages. In p2p-server.js:
```
  messageHandler(socket) {
    socket.on('message', message => {
      const data = JSON.parse(message);
      switch(data.type) {
        case MESSAGE_TYPES.chain:
          this.blockchain.replaceChain(data.chain);
          break;
        case MESSAGE_TYPES.transaction:
          this.transactionPool.updateOrAddTransaction(data.transaction);
          break;
      }
    …
  }
```

Now in app/index.js, use the broadcastTransaction function in the ‘/transact’ endpoint. That way, transactions are broadcasted to the network whenever new ones are made:
```
p2pServer.broadcastTransaction(transaction);
```

Now start up a couple instances to test the new endpoint:
$ npm run dev
Second command line tab:
$ HTTP_PORT=3002 P2P_PORT=5002 PEERS=ws://localhost:5001 npm run dev

Then post transactions. Hit localhost:3001/transact. Select POST for the type of request, and make sure the type of data is Raw, application/json. Then have a json body that consists of an arbitrary recipient, and a value around 50:
```
{
	"recipient": "foo-4dr3ss",
	"amount": 50
}
```

With those inputs loaded in, go ahead and click `Send` a couple times.

Hit the transactions endpoint on both instances:
- localhost:3001/transactions
- localhost:3002/transactions

Make a second POST transaction, this time with the second instance, http://localhost:3002/transact:
```
{
	"recipient": "bar-4dr3ss",
	"amount": 40
}
```

Hit the transactions endpoint on both instances:
- localhost:3001/transactions
- localhost:3002/transactions
