Transactions objects represent exchanges in the cryptocurrency. They will consist of three primary components: 1) an input field which provides information about the sender of the transaction. 2) output fields which detail how much currency the sender is giving to other wallets, and 3) a unique `id` to identify the transaction object. To generate an id for transactions, use a module called uuid which stands for universally unique identifier:

$ npm i uuid --save

Use the new uuid module in chain-util.js, and create a `static id` function within the `ChainUtil` class.
```
const uuidV1 = require('uuid/v1');

…

static id() {
  return uuidV1();
}
```

Move on to creating the actual transaction class. Create a transaction.js file within the wallet directory:
 - Create wallet/transaction.js

Create the Transaction class, with the ability to generate a new transaction within wallet/transaction.js:
```
const ChainUtil = require('../chain-util');

class Transaction {
  constructor() {
    this.id = ChainUtil.id();
    this.input = null;
    this.outputs = [];
  }

  static newTransaction(senderWallet, recipient, amount) {
    if (amount > senderWallet.balance) {
      console.log(`Amount: ${amount} exceeds balance.`);
      return;
    }

    const transaction = new this();

    transaction.outputs.push(...[
      { amount: senderWallet.balance - amount, address: senderWallet.publicKey },
      { amount, address: recipient }
    ]);

    return transaction;
  }
}

module.exports = Transaction;
```
