To extend this blockchain with a cryptocurrency, we’ll need wallet objects. Wallets will store the balance of an individual, and approve transactions (exchanges of currency) by generating signatures.

- Create wallet/
- Create wallet/index.js

In the default wallet/index.js file, create the Wallet class. Every wallet instance will have three fields. First is a balance, which is set to `INITIAL_BALANCE`. This will variable will be a value every wallet begins with. This helps get the economy flowing. Second, it has a `keyPair` object. The keyPair object will contain methods that can return the private key for the wallet, as well as its public key. Third and finally, it has a publicKey field. The public key also serves as the public address for the wallet, and is what other individuals in the network use to send currency to the wallet.
```
const { INITIAL_BALANCE } = require('../config');

class Wallet {
  constructor() {
    this.balance = INITIAL_BALANCE;
    this.keyPair = null;
    this.publicKey = null;
  }

  toString() {
    return `Wallet -
    publicKey : ${this.publicKey.toString()}
    balance   : ${this.balance}`
  }
}

module.exports = Wallet;
```

Right now, the balance of each wallet has been set to a global variable that doesn’t exist yet. So in config.js, declare the INITIAL_BALANCE, and set it to 500:
```
...
const INITIAL_BALANCE  = 500;

module.exports = { DIFFICULTY, MINE_RATE, INITIAL_BALANCE };
```
