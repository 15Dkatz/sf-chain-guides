Create a system that automatically adjusts the difficulty as more miners are added to the blockchain. In config.js, create a `MINE_RATE` constant to represent the millisecond rate that blocks should be mined:
```
...
const MINE_RATE = 3000;
module.exports = { DIFFICULTY, MINE_RATE };
```
Add difficulty attributes to each block in the chain. In the `Block` class of `block.test.js`:
```
constructor(timestamp, lastHash, hash, data, nonce, difficulty) {
  …
  this.difficulty = difficulty || DIFFICULTY;
}
...
static hash(timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty) {
  return SHA256(`${timestamp}${lastHash}${data}${nonce}${difficulty}`).toString();
}

static blockHash(block) {
  const { timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty } = block;
  return Block.hash(timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty);
}

// Update `toString()`
Difficulty: ${this.difficulty}

`` Update `static genesis()`
return new this('Genesis time', '-----', 'f1r57-h45h', [], 0, DIFFICULTY);
```
The difficulty of each block will be based on the difficulty of the block that came before it. Update the `static mineBlock` function:
```
static mineBlock(lastBlock, data) {
 	let hash, timestamp;
	const lastHash = lastBlock.hash;
	let { difficulty } = lastBlock;
	let nonce = 0;

 	do {
		nonce++;
		timestamp = Date.now();
		difficulty = Block.adjustDifficulty(lastBlock, timestamp);
		hash = Block.hash(timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty);
	} while (hash.substring(0, difficulty) !== '0'.repeat(difficulty));

	return new this(timestamp, lastHash, hash, data, nonce, difficulty);
  }
```
Add the `adjustDifficulty` function:
```
static adjustDifficulty(lastBlock, currentTime) {
	let { difficulty } = lastBlock;
	difficulty = lastBlock.timestamp + MINE_RATE > currentTime ?
  difficulty + 1 : difficulty - 1;
  return difficulty;
}
```
